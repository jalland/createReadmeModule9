  # Recipe App 
  ## Description
  When trying to find a recipe for food and drinks, sometimes it takes a long time to surf the internet, find a recipe, and scroll a long time before finally finding the ingredients list. This app allows a user to type in a food and drink, and a beautiful picture and a recipe are displayed to a screen. That way, a user can quickly copy the ingredients to their grocery list.
